This file is dedicated to the third task that am supposed to complete as a DATA SCIENCE intern.

Building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service involves several steps, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation. 
The best way to build a decision tree classifier is by using Python and the scikit-learn library,  which helps to make the task easier
